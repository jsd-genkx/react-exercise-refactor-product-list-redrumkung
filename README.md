Step-by-Step Instructions:
Step 1: Create the Main Application Component (App.jsx)
Initialize State: Use useState to create a state variable for the list of products (products)

const [products, setProducts] = useState([ { id: "pid-1", name: "Product 1", price: 10.0, image: "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTIXzoYdO9tqmkjlVHmpgXnOsQb9DWkz_Mfi1Jc7zNzaw&s", isSelected: false, },
{ id: "pid-2", name: "Product 2", price: 10.0, image: "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTIXzoYdO9tqmkjlVHmpgXnOsQb9DWkz_Mfi1Jc7zNzaw&s", isSelected: false, }, ])

Step 2: Create the ProductList Component (ProductList.jsx)
Step 3: Create the ProductForm Component (ProductForm.jsx)


Tasks:
Implement the Components: Follow the instructions above to implement App, ProductList, and ProductForm components.
Understand Props: Make sure to understand how data and functions are passed as props from the App component to ProductList and ProductForm.
State Management: Pay attention to how useState is used to manage the state in each component.
